\chapter{Direct inverse ray mapping for systems with Fresnel reflection}
\label{chap:fresnel}

% Fresnel's equation give a physically accurate expression for the power transmission and reflection according to angle. For all but some special anhles a ray splits up into a reflected and transmitted ray. Both carry off some of the incident energy. For accurate ray tracing this means that both have to be followed theought optics. However, this splitting happens at each interface
In this chapter we present the inverse ray mapping method for systems consisting of optical lines for which Fresnel reflection can occur. We consider unpolarized light. In particular, we explain how to calculate the boundaries of the regions of positive luminance in target PS. We provide numerical results for a simple system formed by the source, a Fresnel lens and the target. 
The chapter starts with a general introduction of the method, then the details are explained for a simple system, finally we show the results obtained for this system.
\section{Introduction}
Including Fresnel reflections, every time that it hits an optical line, it splits into a reflected and a refracted ray, both of them carry a part of the incident energy.
%The amount of light that is reflected and refracted is given by the reflectance and transmittance which are related to Fresnel coefficients (see ). 
Hence, a ray emitted from the source generates two rays after interaction with the optical lines (the reflected ray and the transmitted one) each of them has the fraction of the original power given by the reflectance $\mathcal{R}$ and the transmittance $\mathcal{T}$ obtained from Fresnel equations (see Equations \ref{Fresnel_pands}).
At the next intersection of the two rays with a line, each incident ray is split
again. This process is called \textit{ray splitting}. 
This results in tracing a rapidly increasing number of rays, including those containing very little power (at every interaction the power of the ray decreases). 
%The ray emitted from the source is called the parent ray. Once it hits a line one of the two rays keeps the parent status while the other one is called child ray. The convention is to assign the parent status to the ray transporting the most power.
Many different paths can occur and the number of paths is determined considering all the possible combinations that a ray emanating from the source can generate. The number of possibilities increases with the number of optical lines that form the system. For example, for a system formed by a source, one single Fresnel line and a target, two possibilities can occur since a ray emitted from the source can either refract reaching the target or reflect going back to the source. Note that no scattering phenomena are considered in this thesis. If the system is formed by a source, two Fresnel lines and a target much more paths are possible since the ray can reflect forward and backward between the two optical lines before arriving either at the target or at the source again. For systems where multiple reflections can occur the number of paths can increases dramatically. Ray splitting is a powerful and accurate ray tracing method to calculate \textit{all} physical paths. The disadvantage is that it generates more and more rays many of which are not significant for computing the target intensity. This makes methods based on ray splitting time consuming. A stopping criterion is needed. Rays generation can be controlled either neglecting rays with a small flux or limiting the total number of interactions that a ray can undergo during its propagation. \\ \indent A different ray tracing approach could be to decide for each ray whether its reflected or refracted part has to be considered every time that an optical line is encountered. Such methods are called \textit{one ray in one ray out} because the number of rays emitted from the source equals the number of rays traced through the system, \cite{koshel2012illumination}.\\ \indent
MC and QMC ray tracing are examples of these kind of processes. They consider a single ray every time that it hits an optical line. At every intersection between the ray and the line the transmittance $\mathcal{T}$ and reflectance $\mathcal{R}$ are determined. Next, a randomly generated number between $0$ and $1$ establishes which path the rays will continue to follow. Usually the assumption is to consider the reflected ray when $\mathcal{R}$ is greater than the random number, and the transmitted one otherwise. Therefore, for each ray traced a unique path is possible and the number of rays emitted from the source equals the total number of rays traced. Compared to methods that consider all possible paths, MC and QMC are easy to implement and the computational time required to achieve a good accuracy is reduced. However it has the disadvantages that part of the energy is lost, therefore the luminance at the target will be always less than the luminance at the source of the system. To achieve a very accurate luminance or intensity distribution at the target, many rays need to be traced.
\\ \indent 
To improve the existing methods, we here apply the direct inverse ray mapping to systems formed by Fresnel lines. For every incident ray we take into account of both the reflected and the refracted ray. Therefore, for a given position and direction of a ray emitted by the source at least two paths are allowed. As explained above, the number of paths depends on the Fresnel lines encountered by the rays. As the inverse ray mapping traces the rays backwards, not all of these paths are \textit{physical} paths, i.e., paths from the source to the target. Nevertheless, it can happen that starting from the same ray coordinates, more than one physical path is permitted. A point in source PS can correspond to two or more points in target PS. Therefore, considering Fresnel reflections, the regions in target PS formed by the rays that follow the same path overlap. To calculate the boundaries of these regions correctly, we run direct inverse ray mapping by considering each physical paths one by one. Every time that direct inverse ray tracing is applied, we consider either the reflected or the refracted ray depending on the path of which we want to determine the boundary. This allows determining the boundaries of the corresponding region in target PS. Furthermore, the power of every ray at each intersection with a line is calculated. Hence, once the rays on the boundaries are determined, their corresponding luminance at the target is also calculated. Note that the output luminance cannot be constant along a given direction and it depends on both the position $\variabile{q}$ and the direction $\variabile{p}$ in target PS. To determine the luminance related to the rays that follow a certain path, an interpolation between the rays on the corresponding boundary in PS is required along every direction. The procedure is repeated for all the paths or at least for those needed to obtain a good accuracy. The partial luminance related to every path is computed.
The total luminance is given by the sum of all the partial luminances calculated.
Finally, the intensity is given by an integration of the luminance along all the possible positions.
\\ \indent
The method is presented in detail in the next section for a simple system.
\section{Inverse ray mapping for a Fresnel lens}
In this section we present direct inverse ray mapping for a simple optical system formed by the source, the target and a Fresnel lens formed by two optical lines.
% Why is important
First we describe the geometry of the system, then we explain the method for such system.
\subsection{The geometry of the system}
Let us consider the optical system depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lens}. 
% Geometry of the system
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{lens}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{A Fresnel lens}
The source (line $1$) and the target (line $4$) are located in air ($\n = 1$), the material between lines $2$ and $3$ has index of refraction $\n=1.5$. 
Two detectors (lines $5$ and $6$) are located at the top and the bottom of the lens to detect light exiting from the system. $\point{F}_1 = (0,0)$, $\point{F}_2 = (20,0)$, $D=10$, $\variabile{h}=5$, $\variabile{d}(\variabile{h})=0.5$.}
\label{fig:lens}
 \end{figure}
It is formed by the source (line $1$), a lens formed by two optical lines (line $2$ and $3$), the target (line $4$) and two detectors (line $5$ and $6$) at the top and the bottom of the system. The source \point{S} is a vertical line segment located at $\variabile{x}=0$ and with 
$\variabile{z}\in[-\variabile{h}, \variabile{h}]$ where $\variabile{h}=5$. The target \point{T} is a line segment of the same length, parallel to \point{S} and located at a distance $\variabile{x}=\variabile{a}$ from \point{S} with $\variabile{a} = 20$. The lens is formed by two refractive lines (simple lens), and it is convex as it is thicker at its middle point than at its edges.
The lens is symmetric with respect to the axis $\variabile{x}=10$. The optical axis is the line $\variabile{z}=0$. The point $\point{F}_1 = (0,0)$ and $F_2 = (\variabile{a}, 0)$ with $\variabile{a} = 20$ are the focal points of line $2$ and $3$, i.e., the points where a collimated beam of light will converge after the interaction with line $2$ and $3$, respectively \cite{leutz2012nonimaging}.

  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{A Fresnel lens.} 
All the rays exiting from $\point{F}_1$ arrive at $\point{F}_2$.}
\label{fig:real-lens}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent The optical path length is defined as the product of the geometric ray path and the refractive index in which the ray travels where the geometric ray path is the distance between two intersection points of the ray with two optical lines or the source.
Fermat's principle guarantees that the optical path length is constant \cite{greivenkamp2004field}. Employing Fermat principle, we derive the equations of the curved lines. In the following we explain how the equation for the left lens (line $2$) is obtained. We indicate with $\variabile{d}(\variabile{z})$ half of the lens thickness at high $\variabile{z}$, with $\vect{r}(\variabile{z})$ the parametrization of the ray emitted from $\point{F}_1$ that reaches line $2$ at height $\variabile{z}$, and $u(\variabile{z})$ is the projection of $\vect{r}(\variabile{z})$ on the optical axis. 
The following relations hold:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:variables_lens}
\begin{aligned}
|\vect{r}(\variabile{z})|^{2} &= |u(\variabile{z})|^2+\variabile{z}^{\,2},\\
u(\variabile{z}) &= |D-\variabile{d}(\variabile{z})|, 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The optical path length is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_length}
n_2|\vect{r}(\variabile{z})|+n_2|\variabile{d}(\variabile{z})|=OPL,
\end{equation}  
where $OPL>0$ is a constant obtained from 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_length2}
OPL = u(\variabile{h})+n_2\variabile{d}(\variabile{h}).
\end{equation} Substituting reletions (\ref{eq:variables_lens}) in the previous equation,
we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lens_equation}
a\,u(\variabile{z})^2+b\,u(\variabile{z})+c+\variabile{z}^2 = 0,
\end{equation}
for every $\variabile{z}\in[-\variabile{h}, \variabile{h}]$, where 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a & = 1-\n_2^2, \\
b & = 2\n_2(\n_2 D-OPL), \\
c & = -(OPL^2-\n_2 D\,OPL)^2. \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:lens_equation} leads to two real solutions, the negative one gives the expression for the left Fresnel.
The right lens is given by a reflection with respect to the axis $\variabile{x}=0$ and a translation $(\variabile{x}, \variabile{z})\rightarrow (\variabile{x}+20, \variabile{z})$.
\\ \indent The lens described above has the property that every ray that hits each curved line is bent towards the optical axis. The rays passing through it connect the points $\point{F}_1 $ and $\point{F}_2$ (see Figure \ref{fig:real-lens}). Therefore, all the rays diverging from $\point{F}_1$ converge to $\point{F}_2$. In the next section we explain how to apply direct inverse ray mapping to this system.
\subsection{}
Our goal is to show, using direct inverse ray mapping extended to this system, we can detect \textit{all} the possible paths limiting the number of rays traced. Furthermore, we are able to determine the rays that are located at the boundaries of the regions corresponding to a certain physical path.
First, let us analyze the inverse ray tracing process for the system in Figure \ref{fig:lens}. Every ray is traced backward from the target $\point{T}$ with an angle $\myangle_1\in[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, i.e., with a direction $\variabile{p}_1\in[-1,1]$. Every time that a ray hits a Fresnel lens, i.e. either line $2$ or $3$, the ray is split in two rays, the reflected ray and the refracted one. The reflectance $\mathcal{R}$ and the transmittance $\mathcal{T}$ are calculated. The reflected ray will continue to propagate within the system with the fraction of the power given by $\mathcal{R}$. Similarly, the transmitted ray will travel inside the system with the power given by $\mathcal{T}$. The trajectory of each ray is stopped either when it arrives at the source \point{S} or when it reaches again the target \point{T}. This leads to many different paths for a single ray with a given initial position and direction. Note that at every interaction with a Fresnel line the ray loses some energy because it is split into two more rays.
%To avoid that rays with a small power are traced through the system some ray tracing methods have been developed such that either the reflected or the refracted part of each ray is considered at every intersection with a Fresnel line. Therefore all the number of ray emitted from the source equals the number of total rays traced as no splitting is considered.  
%To detect the rays with more reflections using either MC or QMC ray tracing, more rays are needed. The number of paths possible are much more, potentially infinity paths.  
\\ \indent
Consider the target PS of the system in Figure \ref{fig:lens}. Since the source and the target are vertical lines (the $\variabile{x}$-coordinates are fixed while the $\variabile{z}$-coordinates vary), the PS coordinates are $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$, where  $\variabile{p}$ is the ray direction coordinate defined as for the previous systems while $\variabile{q}$ is the $\variabile{z}$ coordinate of the intersection point of the ray with the optical lines. To have an idea about the rays distribution at the target we represent the target coordinates on PS of $10^5$ rays traced using MC ray tracing. MC ray tracing decides randomly which part of the ray has to be considered at every interaction with a line. This part propagates with the corresponding energy. Running MC ray tracing for the lens in Figure \ref{fig:lens} with $10^5$ rays and storing the corresponding paths, the following three paths are found:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:paths_fresnel}
\begin{aligned}
\Pi_1 & = (1,2,3,4),\\
\Pi_2 & = (1,2,3,2,3,4), \\
\Pi_3 & = (1,2,3,2,3,2,3,4).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In Figure \ref{fig:target_PS_lens} we provide the target PS of the Fresnel lens where we depicted rays that follow the same path with the same color. The rays in magenta are rays that follow path $\Pi_1$, the cyan rays have two reflections before reaching the target, following path $\Pi_2$, the black rays have four reflections inside the lens, these rays follow path $\Pi_3$ (see Equation (\ref{eq:paths_fresnel})).
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{target_lens}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Target PS of the Fresnel lens}
The magenta rays follow path $\Pi_1$, the cyan rays follow path $\Pi_2$ and the black rays follow path $\Pi_3$.}
\label{fig:target_PS_lens}
 \end{figure}
Note that for increasing number of reflections the corresponding rays occur less frequently in PS. Furthermore, some parts \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$ are not covered by any ray. Therefore, rays that from two close position coordinates at the source with close direction coordinates can follow different paths. This can be due to either TIR or a different choice of rays (reflected or refracted) at the intersections with Fresnel lines. In the first case, the rays will be located outside the region \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$, otherwise they can reach the interior of \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$. The latter case implies that, given two different paths $\Pi_{\variabile{i}}$ and $\Pi_{\variabile{j}}$ with $\variabile{i}\neq\variabile{j}$, the corresponding regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_{\variabile{i}})$ and \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_{\variabile{j}})$ can overlap in target PS. Thus:
\begin{equation}
\bigcap_{\Pi}\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)\neq \emptyset,
\end{equation}
where the intersection is over all the possible paths. 
% Say that simply applying bisection and ray tracing is not enough
Because of this, we need to slightly modify direct inverse ray mapping explained in the previous chapter to detect all the possible paths. \\ \indent
The key idea is to apply the bisection method combined with inverse ray tracing for every single path $\Pi$ separately. All the possible paths from the target to the source can be visualized in the tree in Figure \ref{fig:tree_fresnel}. $R$ and $T$ indicate whether the reflected or the transmitted part of the ray is considered at every intersection point. Many possibilities can occur, we indicate with $C$ the sequence of the choices that are made at every intersection with the Fresnel lens. For example, the path $\Pi_1$ in reverse order, that is 
$\Pi_1^{\prime}=(4,3,2,1)$ corresponds to the choice $C_1= (T,T)$ from the target to the source (red path in Figure \ref{fig:tree_fresnel}). This means that the rays that follow path $\Pi_1$ are transmitted on both line $2$ and $3$. 
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{tree_lens}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Tree with all the possible paths.} Considering Fresnel reflections the rays can reflect many times between line $2$ and $3$ before reaching either the target or one of the two detectors or the source again. The inverse of path $\Pi_1 = (1,2,3,4)$ that is $\Pi_1^{\prime} = (4,3,2,1)$ is depicted in red. It corresponds to the choice $C_1= (T,T)$.}
\label{fig:tree_fresnel}
 \end{figure}
To find the intersection point of boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$ with line $\variabile{p} = \textrm{const}$, we start tracing back the rays with corresponding coordinates $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})$ located at the end points of the target PS, where $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}} = -\variabile{h}$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}} = \variabile{h}$ and $\variabile{h}=5$. Then the bisection method and inverse ray tracing is applied as explained in the previous chapter. However, the difference is that when the rays hit a Fresnel line is split into two rays and either the reflected or the refracted ray has to be considered according to the choice $C_1= (T,T)$. The correspondig energy transporting by the ray his calculated at every split. This allows us to determine the coordinates of the intersection points between line $\variabile{p}=\textrm{const}$ and the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$ which are denoted with $(\variabile{q}^{\variabile{i}}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})_{\variabile{i}=1, \cdots, \variabile{r}}$ where $\variabile{r}$ is the number of intersections point found. In case $\variabile{r}=2$ we indicate the coordinates of the two rays on the boundaries with $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$. \\ \indent
Note that, including Fresnel reflection, the luminance at the target cannot be constant because its value depends on Fresnel coefficients. Hence, along every direction $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$, we sample points in \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$ by tracing back rays with direction coordinate $\variabile{p}$ and position coordinate $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{2i-1}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{2i-1}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p})]$ for every $\variabile{i}=\{1, \cdots, \variabile{m}$ where $\variabile{m}$ is the integer part of $\variabile{r}/2$. At every intereraction of each ray with a Fresnel lens, either the reflected of the transmitted ray is taken into occount according to the sequence choices $C_1$. The energy carried by each ray is calculated. Therefore the partial luminance $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q},\variabile{p})$ corresponding to path $\Pi_1$ is found. 
%The interpolation between 
%$(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ allows us to calculate the profile of $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q},\variabile{p})$ for every $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}]$ and $\variabile{p}=\textrm{const}$.
% as it depends on the Fresnel coefficients which are related to the angle of the incident ray at every Fresnel line and to the index of refraction in which the ray travels (see Equations (\ref{eq:fresnel_pands2})). Therefore and interpolation between the coordinates of the rays on the boundaries gives the value of the luminance $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ along direction $\variabile{p}= \textrm{const}$ related to path $\Pi_1$.
Repeating the procedure for all the possible directions $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$, the profile of the partial luminance $L_{\Pi_1}$ given by all the rays that follow path $\Pi_1$ is computed for every $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})\in$\set{T}{}{}. 
\\ \indent Next, another path $\Pi$ and the corresponding sequence of choices $C$ are considered. We remark that every path is associated to a unique choice but the reverse is not always true. For example, the path $\Pi_2 = (1,2,3,2,3,4)$ considered in reverse order from the \point{T} to \point{S}, (i.e., $\Pi_2^{\prime} = (4,3,2,3,2,1)$) can only be associated to sequence $C_2 = (T,R,R,T)$ which leads also to the two inverse paths $\Pi_5^{\prime}= (4,3,2,3,2,5)$ and $\Pi_6^{\prime}= (4,3,2,3,2,6)$. The last two paths, $\Pi_5^{\prime}$ and $\Pi_6^{\prime}$ are not \textit{physical} paths from the target to the source, therefore they are discarded for the intensity calculation. Given a sequance $C$, many paths are possible but only one is the physical path. In the flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart_fresnel}, we show all the steps needed to calculate the partial luminance $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$  along a given direction $\variabile{p}$ and related to path $\Pi_1 = (1,2,3,4)$ which corresponds to the sequence of choices $C= (T,T)$. The procedure to determine the other paths is similar.

  \caption{\textbf{Main steps of the inverse ray mapping extended to systems with Fresnel reflection.}}
\label{fig:flowchart_fresnel}
 \end{figure}
Considering \textit{all} the possible sequences of choices, \textit{all} the physical paths are determined. The corresponding partial luminance $L_{\Pi}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ along every direction $\variabile{p}\in [-1,1]$ and for every position coordinate $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi, \variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi, \variabile{p})]$ is calculated for every path $\Pi$. 
\\ \indent Finally, the total luminance $L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:luminance_fresnel}
L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p}) = \sum_{\Pi}L_{\Pi}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p}),
\end{equation} 
where the summation is over all the possible paths. 
From an integration of $L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ the intensity at the target is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intensity_fresnel}
I(\variabile{p}) = \int_{\mbox{\set{Q}{}{}}}L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})\textrm{d}\variabile{q}.
\end{equation}
\\ \indent In the next section numerical results are shown.
\section{Numerical results}
In this section the numerical results for the lens are presented. We detect the boundaries of the regions formed by the rays that follow the same path for every physical path. To this purpose we decide a priori the sequence of choices that has to be made at every intersection. This sequence determines whether the reflected or the transmitted part of the incident ray has to be considered when the rays traced back hit a Fresnel line.\\ \indent
We start with the sequence of choices $C_1 = (T,T)$ which corresponds to the physical path $\Pi_1=(1,2,3,4)$.
Indeed, every ray traced back hits the right curved line (line $3$) and is split in two rays, at this point the reflectance $\mathcal{R}$ and transmittance $\mathcal{T}$ are calculated and, according to the first component of $C_1$, the transmitted ray is considered and traced back further with the corresponding power $\mathcal{T}$. This ray continues to propagate through the system until it hits either the detectors (line $5$ and $6$) or the curved line $2$.
In case it hits the detectors the procedure is stopped, otherwise the ray is split again into two more rays. Now, according to the second component of $C_1$, the transmitted ray is considered and it continues its trajectory reaching either the detectors or the source (line $1$). For example, in Figure \ref{fig:ray_path1} we draw in red a ray that follows path $\Pi_1 = (1,2,3,4)$. It is traced back from the target and has target PS coordinates $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})=(0, -0.4)$. It arrives at the source with around the $55\%$ of the initial power.\\ \indent 
Using direct inverse ray mapping and taking into account the choice $C_1$, the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$ is found which is the blue line in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_path1}. To verify whether this boundary is correct we trace around $10^4$ rays using MC ray tracing imposing that at every interaction of the ray with lines $2$ and $3$ always the transmitted part of is considered. These rays are displayed in red in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_path1}. The picture shows that all the rays traced are inside the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$, which is obviously calculated correctly.

\caption{\textbf{Computation of the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$.}}
\end{figure}
\\ \indent To detect the other paths we need to consider all possible sequences. We continue with $C_2 = (T, R, R, T)$. This means that once the ray is traced back from the target and, if it hits line $3$, the transmitted part is considered according to the first component of $C_2$. Next, it is traced back further with its corresponding power given by $\mathcal{T}$. If the transmitted ray does not hit one of the detectors, it hits line $2$ where it is split again. Now the reflected part of the ray is considered according to the second component of $C_2$. The power of the reflected ray is given by the product $\mathcal{R}\cdot \mathcal{T}$. The ray continues to propagates inside the system, if it hits line $3$ it is reflected according to the third component of $C_2$ and, in case it hits line $2$ next, it is finally transmitted according to the last component of $C_2$. If the ray finally reaches the source, it has followed the physical path $\Pi_2 = (1,2,3,2,3,4)$. 
In Figure \ref{fig:ray_path2} we show in cyan a ray traced back from the target to the source that follows path $\Pi_2$. The ray with target PS coordinates $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})=(0,-0.37)$ is traced back and after two reflections inside the lens it arrives at the source with $7.2\%$ of the initial energy. Direct inverse ray mapping combined with sequence $C_2$ provides the boundary of the region $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_2)$ which is depicted in blue in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_path2}. To properly detect the boundary we divided the target PS into $\textrm{Ni}=10$ bins as explained in Section \ref{sec:TIR}. Like for the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_1)$, to prove that the method computes the boundary correctly we traced $10^4$ rays using MC ray tracing in combination with sequence $C_2$. These rays are shown in cyan in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_path2}. We observe that all rays traced are located inside the blue line, therefore the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_2)$ is calculated correctly.

\\ \indent Since more than two reflections can occur between line $2$ and $3$, the procedure continues considering the sequence $C_3 = (T,R,R,R,R,T)$ leading to four reflections between line $2$ and $3$. Every ray traced back from the target is first transmitted, then reflected between $2$ and $3$ four times and finally transmitted again. If the ray hits the source then it has followed the physical path $\Pi_{3} = (1,2,3,2,3,2,3,4)$ corresponding to sequence $C_3$. An example of a ray that follows path $\Pi_3$ is depicted in black in Figure \ref{fig:ray_path3}. The ray is traced back from the target with target PS coordinates $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})=(0,-0.39)$. It arrives at the source with a power equal to $0.0073\%$ of the initial energy. The inverse ray mapping with the sequence $C_3$ gives the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_3)$ depicted in blue in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_path3}. This boundary is obtained dividing the target PS into $\textrm{Ni}=10$ bins and applying the inverse ray mapping to each bin. The black dots correspond to the rays in target PS obtained using MC ray tracing in combination with sequence $C_3$ with $10^4$ rays. Also in this case we found that the boundary computation is correct.

Direct inverse ray mapping is able to detect \textit{all} the boundaries of \textit{all} regions of positive luminance in target PS. Since rays with multiple reflections hardly contribute to the total power, we discard rays with more than four reflections. The procedure can be stopped accordingly to the desired accuracy. The more reflections are considered, the better the accuracy. \\ \indent
Note that the luminance at the target cannot be constant because every ray carries a certain amount of energy that depends on the Fresnel coefficients. Because of this, a sampling between the rays on the boundaries is needed to compute the profile of the luminance at the target. In Figure \ref{fig:interpolation1} we show the procedure to compute the luminance related to path $\Pi_1$ along direction $\variabile{p}=0$. A sample of rays with corresponding coordinates $(\variabile{q}(\Pi_1, \variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ where $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p})]$ and $\variabile{p}=0$ are traced from the target to the source using the inverse ray tracing and taking into account sequence $C_1$. The rays traced are depicted in red. The luminance $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ is calculated for every $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p})]$ and $\variabile{p}=0$. Its profile is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:luminance_fresnel}.

\\\indent 
Repeating the procedure explained above along all possible directions $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$, the partial luminance $L_{\Pi_1}(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ is found for every $\variabile{q}\in[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi_1,\variabile{p})]$ and $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$. The same procedure is applied to all the paths considered and the luminance corresponding to each path is calculated. The total luminance $L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ is given by the sum in Equation (\ref{eq:luminance_fresnel}). Finally, the intensity is computed using Equation (\ref{eq:intensity_fresnel}). \\ \indent
We do not show here the numerical results of the total luminance and intensity because the work is still in progress. Our expectation is that the direct inverse ray mapping is suitable also for systems with Fresnel reflection. Indeed, the preliminary results show that the boundaries of the regions with positive luminance are calculated correctly. Once the boundaries are found also the luminance and the intensity can be computed applying an interpolation between the rays at the boundaries along every possible direction. Furthermore we expect that the method is much more accurate and faster than both MC and QMC ray tracing. This because we can analyze every single path independently from the others.  
\section{Conclusion and outlook}
In this chapter we introduced the direct inverse ray mapping extended to optical systems where Fresnel reflection plays a role. We observed that a ray emitted from the source can follow many different paths as it is split into two rays every time that it hits a Fresnel line. Thus, a unique point at the source PS can correspond to several points in target PS. This results in an overlap of the regions with positive luminance in target PS. The purpose of the method is to detect the boundaries of \textit{all} these regions. This can be done fixing a priori which part of the ray has to be considered at every intersection of the ray with a Fresnel line. \\\indent Direct inverse ray mapping is extended in this chapter such that only one boundary is computed at each run. The procedure is run as many times as the number of sequences of choices we want to consider. We presented preliminarly numerical results for a system formed by the source, the target and a Fresnel lens formed by two curved lines. We shown that the method is able to determine the boundaries of all the regions with positive luminance correctly. We noticed that including Fresnel reflections the luminance cannot be constant. An interpolation between the rays on the boundaries is needed to obtain the luminance profile. We provided an example of such interpolation for a given path and along a certain direction. Furthermore, we explained the theory for the luminance and the intensity computation. \\ \indent
Future work might regard the calculation of the luminance and the intensity and a comparison with both MC and QMC ray tracing. Numerical results on the intensity computation should be provided.
