Looking back at the journey to pursue my PhD, I realize how many things happened in just four years. This thesis would probably have been never finished without the support of many people, who I would like to thank here.  

First and foremost, my gratitude goes to my supervisors for leading me along this path. I would never be able to write this thesis without their help.

Wilbert, thank you for your constant support and patience. Every meeting and discussion with you contributed to both this work and my professional growth. 
You listened to all my doubts and replied to my questions at any time of the day.
I learned a lot from you and I am impressed about the breadth of your knowledge and the passion you have for your work. 

Jan, thanks for being extremely available and for your daily encouragement. The door of your office was always open for any advice. 
I really appreciated your meticulousness in correcting the text of my papers and of this thesis, this helped me a lot to improve my writing skills.

I am thankful to Teus Tukker, who was one of my supervisors during the first year of my PhD. It is a pity you have taken only a small part in this project, your guidance had a big impact to me.

I would like to express my gratitude to all members of my doctorate committee for having agreed to referee my thesis and for their fruitful comments.  

I would extend my appreciation to Jorg for providing with his master thesis (from which this work started) and for the time he dedicated to me with further explanations.

I wish to thank Carlo for the helpful discussions about Chapter \ref{chap:raytracing} and for the cover of my thesis. 

Carla, Guido, Michele, Giacomo, Jan and Wilbert, thank you for helping out with the final decision on the cover. \\

My first approach with the Netherlands wasn't easy at all. As many international people, especially Italians, I was complaining about food, coffee, weather and, most of all, about bikes. 
I would have never been able to deeply enjoy the beauty of this country if I hadn't meet great friends and colleagues.

I am indebted with all CASA members for creating a nice and international work atmosphere. This would never have been possible without the help of Enna, Marese and Jolijn who organized very nice events within CASA group. Thanks Enna for helping me with the university bureaucracy.

I also found a cozy working environment in Philips Lighting. I thanks all the people working there for bringing enthusiasm every day, I really enjoyed the international cooking events. I thank especially Andrea for her help and availability.

Thanks to my current and former officemates: Nitin, Thomas, Mohammad, Harshit, Behnaz, Deepesh, Yuriy and Pranav for helping me to remain focused every day.
In particular, thanks to Deepesh and Behnaz for having supported me and for the nice and pleasant time we spent together. I will be always grateful for your friendship. 

Laura, thank you for your cute and encouraging words during the stressful period while I wrote this thesis.

Giovanni and Deepesh thanks for hosting me at your place when I wasn't able to walk. I will never forget the kindness and thoughtfulness you had for me.


Letizia, Gonzalo and Giovannino thank you for walking with me very slowly around the city and for finding the time to have a chat together. Also, thanks Letizia for always being available to pick me up with your car.

Carla for organizing me a great birthday party and for cooking delicious Italian dishes for all of us. \\

During these years, I also had the opportunity to join the \emph{Kabelstraat} events. I am thankful to all people there for the funny evenings and good dinners together.

I wish to thanks my friends and former colleagues back in Italy: Federica, Ida, Stefania, Daniela and Arianna. It was nice to study with you at the university and it looks amazing to me that after many years we are still in touch.

Misa, Ale G., Ghislaine, Chiara, Manouk, Tsvetan and Jacopo, I will never regret to have shared a house with you. Thanks for never making me feel lonely coming back home after work. Thanks to you, I discovered the beauty and the difficulty to meet up with people of different cultures.

During these years I found a concentration of Italians at the fourth floor of our department. Thanks Ale G., Ale Z., Carlo, Enrico, Fabio, Gianmarco, Lorenzo, Marta and Misa for making me feel like home. I will miss our barbecue parties in Tongelresestraat.\\

Before starting my PhD, I would never thought of start doing climbing in a flat country. This sport has the power to make my mind rest after long days in the office.
I would like to thank all my climbing friends for motivating me and for sharing with me this passion. Most of all, Ale Z. for being my personal climbing teacher, and Carlo for making me discover how wonderful is to climb on the real rock.\\ 

A special thank goes to my family, especially to my parents and my sister.

Dad, you have been always a mystery for me. I am not able to explain all my emotions, but I can say for sure that the strongest feelings I have for you are love and endearment. Thank you for all you did for our family. I like thinking you have been at my side for all these years, and that now you are proud of me.

Thanks to my mother for her support. Mamma, grazie per avermi supportato in ogni momento e non aver mai ostacolato le mie scelte nonostante a volte abbiano causato sofferenza e nostalgia per la distanza che ci separa. Il tuo amore e la tua fiducia in me, sono stati fondamentali per il raggiungimento di questo traguardo. Ti voglio bene.   

To my sister Carla for having been part of my \textit{entire} life. Sister, I cannot put into words how grateful I am, and how much I owe you. I would have never been able to achieve none of my successes without you.
I miss sharing the daily life with you, but I feel so lucky when I realize that the distance did change nothing. 

I desire to thank Guido for having organized very beautiful excursions around the south of Germany and for the nice time we spent in the Netherlands with Carla and Carlo. I have a good memory of all the trips we made together. You are a good and warm-hearted person.

Last, but not least, I wish to thank you, Carlo, for your love. 
Thanks for bringing happiness, color and brightness to my life. I cannot imagine my future without you.
