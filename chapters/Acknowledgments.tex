Looking back at the journey to pursue my Ph.D., I realize that many things happened in only four years and that it would not be possible without the help of many people who I would thank here. 

First of all, my gratitude goes to my supervisors for leading me during this path. I would never be able to write this thesis without your help.
Wilbert, thank you for your constant support and patience. Every meeting and discussion with you contributed to this work and to my professional growth. 
You have listened all my doubt and replied to my questions at any time of the day.
I learned a lot from you and I am impressed about the breadth of your knowledge and your passion for the research. 

Jan, thanks for being extremely available. The door of your office was always open when I had a question. I really appreciated your meticulousness in correcting the text of my papers and of this thesis. You helped my improving my writing skills.

Dad, you have been a mystery for all my life. I cannot put in words all my feelings for you but I can say for sure that the strongest are love and endearment. 
I like thinking you have been on my side for all this years and that now you are proud of me.

Mamma, grazie per avermi supportato e sopportato in ogni momento, per non avermi mai ostacolato nelle mie scelte.
