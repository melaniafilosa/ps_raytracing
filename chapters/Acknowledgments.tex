Looking back at the journey to pursue my PhD, I realize that many things happened in only four years and that it would not be possible without the help of many people which I would thank here. 

First my gratitude goes to my supervisors.
Wilbert, thank you for your constant support and patience. You followed this work step by step and every meeting with you contributed %% 
to and to my professional growth.    
I learned a lot from you and I am impressed.

Jan, I thank you

Misa, Ale G., Ghislaine, Chiara, Manouk, Tsvetan and Jacopo, I will never regret to have shared our house with you. You never made me feel lonely at home and I discovered the beauty and the difficulty to meet up with people of different cultures. % dillo meglio
