\chapter{Inverse ray mapping: numerical approach}
\label{chap:raymapping2}
In Chapter \ref{chap:raymapping1} we introduced an inverse method based on ray mapping reconstruction in PS.
The goal was to calculate the intensity distribution at the target of optical systems. 
The idea was to construct a map from the target \point{T} to the source \point{S} using the PS of all the optical lines which are divided into several regions.  
The method developed in the previous chapter requires that the boundaries of these regions can be determined exactly in every PS. This is possible for systems formed by straight line segments.
The results found show that the procedure allows tracing only the rays located exactly on the boundaries of the regions with positive luminance. From these rays, the \textit{exact} intensity was determined. \\ \indent
In this chapter we extend the method to systems formed by curved lines. In this case, the boundaries of the regions that form the PS cannot be determined exactly.
Because of this, we need to apply a numerical procedure. In particular, we develop a method that employs only the PS of the target of the system. 
The boundaries are detected applying a bisection procedure in target PS in combination with the inverse ray tracing.\\ \indent
In this chapter we test the method for two optical systems: the TIR-collimator and a parabolic reflector. The results are presented in Section \ref{sec:TIR} and \ref{sec:PR}, respectively.
\section{Bisection method and inverse ray tracing}\label{sec:raymapping_explanation}
The purpose of this section is to present the generalized inverse ray mapping method valid for systems formed by curved lines. 
Given a partition $-1 = \variabile{p}^0<\variabile{p}^1<\cdots<\variabile{p}^{\nbin}=1$ of the interval $[-1,1]$ with $\nbin$ the number of bins in the partitioning, the intensity in target PS is given by Equation (\ref{eta2}) for every $\dir{}{}\in P$.
Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the coordinates 
$\variabile{q}^{\textrm{\,min}}(\Pi, \variabile{p})$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{\,max}}(\Pi, \variabile{p})$ of the rays on $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ for every path $\Pi$ where we used the same notation of the previous chapter for the rays coordinates.
\\ \indent 
We indicate with $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})= (-\variabile{b}, \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}) = (\variabile{b}, \variabile{p})$ the coordinates of the end points of \set{T}{}{} along direction $\variabile{p}$ and with $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ the parametrization of rays corresponding to these two points.
The coordinates of each ray on line $\lineai\neq \textrm{Nl}$ are indicated with $(\variabile{q}_{\lineai}, \variabile{p}_{\lineai})$ where $\variabile{q}_{\lineai}$ is the position $\variabile{x}$-coordinate of the intersection point between the ray and line $\lineai$ and $\variabile{p}$ is the direction of the ray with respect to the optical axis. Note that $\pos{\lineai}{}=\pos{t,}{\lineai}$ while $\dir{\lineai}{}\neq\dir{t,}{\lineai}$ where $(\pos{t,}{\lineai},\dir{t,}{\lineai})$ are the coordinates of the rays in target PS \set{T}{\lineai}{} introduced in the previous chapter where the directions coordinates where expressed with respect to the normal of $\lineai$. It is useful here to specify with a subscript to which ray every couple of coordinates belongs. For instance, $(\pos{\lineai}{}^{\textrm{a}}, \dir{\lineai}{}^{\textrm{a}})$ are the coordinates of ray $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ on line $\lineai$.\\ \indent 
The procedure starts considering an intensity $I(\variabile{p})=0$ and the end points $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})= (-\variabile{b}, \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}) = (\variabile{b}, \variabile{p})$. Now, since the boundaries of the the regions of all the phase spaces are unknown, to understand from which line $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ are emitted we apply the inverse ray tracing. We denote with $\nline$ the index of the target (line $\nline$) and with $\lineaj\in\{1,\cdots, \nline-1\}$ and $\lineak\in\{1,\cdots, \nline-1\}$ the lines from which $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ are emitted. $\Pi^\textrm{a} = (\lineaj, \nline)$ and $\Pi^\textrm{b} = (\lineak,\nline)$ are the last part of the paths followed by the two rays $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$, respectively. In particular, $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})\in\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{a}})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})\in\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{b}})$. At this stage we know whether the two rays are emitted from the same line or not. \\ \indent 
First, assume $\lineaj= \lineak$, then $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ hit the same line before reaching the target. 
In case $\lineaj = 1$ a possible path from the source to the target is found and the intensity is updated according to:
\begin{equation}
I(p) = I(p)+\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi^\textrm{a}, \variabile{p})-\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi^\textrm{a}, \variabile{p}),
\end{equation}
where $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}} = \min\{\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}\}$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}} = \max\{\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}\}$. In case $\lineaj\neq1$ the two rays $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ are traced back further using inverse ray tracing.
\\ \indent Next, if $\lineaj\neq \lineak$ the rays $\vect{r}_\textrm{a}$ and $\vect{r}_\textrm{b}$ are emitted by two-different lines, hence $\Pi^{\textrm{a}}\neq \Pi^{\textrm{b}}$ and belong to different regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{a}})$ and \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{b}})$ in \set{T}{}{}. To determine the other coordinates of the rays on the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{a}})$, the bisection method is applied to the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}(\Pi^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})]$ in target PS \set{T}{}{} along direction $\variabile{p}$. Thus, this interval is repeatedly halved until the position coordinate in target PS of the ray that follows the same path $\Pi^{\textrm{a}}$ of $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ is found (the corresponding direction coordinate $\variabile{p}$ is fixed). \\ \indent The bisection procedure continues until the length of the segment considered becomes smaller than a fixed tolerance. 
Giving as input the coordinates $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})$ and $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}(\Pi^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})$ of $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$, the path $\Pi^\textrm{a}$ and the tolerance $\textrm{tol}= 10^{-12}$, the bisection method is implemented as in Algorithm \ref{alg:bisection}. Similarly the others paths will be find later using the same procedure applied to another interval in target PS.

\\ \indent Once bisection stops, two points with coordinates $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{c}}, \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{d}}, \variabile{p})$ in \set{T}{}{} are found. The corresponding rays $\vect{r}_{\textrm{c}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{d}}$ follow path $\Pi^{\textrm{c}}=\Pi^{\textrm{a}}$ and $\Pi^{\textrm{d}}\neq\Pi^{\textrm{a}}$. 
All the rays with target coordinates $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ and $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}\leq\variabile{q}\leq\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{c}}$ follow path $\Pi^{\textrm{a}}$, while the rays with target coordinates $(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ with $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{d}}\leq\variabile{q}\leq\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}$ follow another path $\Pi \neq \Pi^{\textrm{a}}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:bisec}). 
%To clarify the procedure, in Figure \ref{fig:bisec} we show an example of target PS of an optical system where Algorithm \ref{alg:bisection} is run for the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}]$ along direction $\variabile{p}=0$. Applying bisection the coordinates $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{p})$ of two points are found. The corresponding rays follow the paths $\Pi^{\textrm{c}}$ and $\Pi^{\textrm{d}}$, where $\Pi^{\textrm{c}}= \Pi^{\textrm{a}}\neq\Pi^{\textrm{d}}$. If $\Pi^{\textrm{c}}$ is a path from the source to the target, Algorithm \ref{alg:bisection} is applied to the sub-interval 
%$[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}(\variabile{p})]$, otherwise the it is applied again to the sub-interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$. The bisection procedure is repeated for all the sub-intervals found along direction $\variabile{p}$, until the entire interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}(\variabile{p})]$ is investigated.

$|\variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}-\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}|<\textrm{tol}$. $\Pi^{\textrm{c}}= \Pi^{\textrm{a}}$ and $\Pi^{\textrm{d}}\neq \Pi^{\textrm{a}}$.}
\label{fig:bisec}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent Now, if $\lineaj\neq1$ the procedure applied to the interval 
$[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$ needs to be applied to $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}),\variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}(\variabile{p})]$ until the source is reached, i.e., until $\lineaj=1$. If $\lineaj=1$, the source is reached by the rays traced back from the target. This means that a possible path $\Pi^{\textrm{a}}$ from \point{S} to \point{T} is found and the position coordinates $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{\,min}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{\,max}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})$ on \set{T}{}{} of the rays located at the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{a}})$ of the rays that follow that path are determined. To determine all the possible paths and the rays on the corresponding boundaries, the bisection procedure needs to be applied again to the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$. First, the rays on the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi^{\textrm{d}})$ will be determined. 
%Next, all the possible paths along direction $\variabile{p}$ are detected by sequentially applying bisection until all the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$ is investigated. 
\\ \indent 
Finally, to detect all the possible paths that can occur along direction $\variabile{p}$ the procedure explained above is applied also to the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$ along direction $\variabile{p}$ continuing until all the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\variabile{p})]$ is investigated. 
The main steps of the method are outlined in the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a direction \variabile{p}, consider the end points $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}^{\,\textrm{a}})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}^{\,\textrm{b}})$ of the target PS \set{T}{}{}, where $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{a}} = -\variabile{b}$, $\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{b}} = \variabile{b}$ and $\variabile{p}^{\,\textrm{a}} = \variabile{p}^{\,\textrm{b}} = \variabile{p}$. Start from $\lineai=\nline$
\item \label{ray trace} Using inverse ray tracing, trace back the rays from line $\lineai$ $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_\textrm{b}$ corresponding to the coordinates  $(\variabile{q}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}})$ and $ (\variabile{q}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}})$. 
%considering the directions $\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}}$ and $\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}}$ with respect to the optical axis. 
%We remind the reader that we indicate with $\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}}$ and $\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}}$ on \set{T}{\lineai}{} the rays directions with respect to the normal of line $\lineai$. Hence, if $\lineai=\nline $ then $\variable{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}}=\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}}=\variabile{p}$, otherwise $\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{a}}\neq\variabile{p}_{\lineai}^{\,\textrm{b}}$.
\item Determine indices $\lineaj\neq\lineai$ and $\lineak\neq\lineai$ of the lines from which  $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ are originated.\\
\item Update the paths $\Pi^\textrm{a}$ and $\Pi^\textrm{b}$, $\Pi^\textrm{a} = (\lineaj, \Pi^{\textrm{a}})$ and $\Pi^\textrm{b} = (\lineak, \Pi^\textrm{b}),$
\item If $\lineaj=\lineak \neq 1$ and $\lineaj=\lineak \neq \nline$
\begin{itemize}
\item $\lineai=\lineaj$
%\item Consider the coordinates of rays $\vect{r}_{\textrm{a}}$ and $\vect{r}_{\textrm{b}}$ on line $\lineaj$ 
\item Restart the procedure from point $\ref{ray trace}$
\end{itemize}
\item If $\lineaj=\lineak= 1$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item A relevant path $\Pi^{\textrm{a}} = \Pi^{\textrm{b}}$ is found. 
\item Determine 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})&=\min\{\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\Pi^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})\}\\ 
\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})&=\max\{\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\Pi^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p})\}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\item Update the intensity $$I(\variabile{p}) = I(p)+\variabile{q}^{\textrm{max}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})-\variabile{q}^{\textrm{min}}(\Pi^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p})$$
\end{itemize}
%\item If $\lineaj=\lineak= \nline$ stop the procedure (the rays reach the target again).
\item If $\lineaj\neq\lineak$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply the bisection method to the interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}]$ along direction $\variabile{p}$.
\item Find the points with coordinates $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{c}}, \variabile{p})$ and $(\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{d}}, \variabile{p})$ in target PS \set{T}{}{} where $|\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{c}}-\variabile{q}^{\,\textrm{d}}|<\textrm{tol}$. 
\item If $\lineaj\neq\nline$
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}) = (\variabile{q}^{\textrm{c}}, \variabile{p})$,
\item $(\variabile{q}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{b}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{b}}) = (\variabile{q}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{c}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{b}})$

\item $\lineai = \lineaj$

\item Restart from $\ref{ray trace}$ with the updated coordinates,
\end{itemize}
\item Update $(\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p} )= (\variabile{q}^{\textrm{d}}, \variabile{p})$,
\item $\Pi^{\textrm{a}} = \Pi^{\textrm{c}}$
\item Update $(\variabile{q}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{a}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{a}}) = (\variabile{q}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{d}}, \variabile{p}_{\lineaj}^{\textrm{d}})$
\item Restart from $\ref{ray trace}$

\end{itemize}

\\ \indent
Next, the method is applied to two optical systems formed by curved lines. In the next section we show the results for the TIR-collimator.
\section{Results for the TIR-collimator}\label{sec:TIR}
% Introduction 
In this section we apply the extended inverse ray mapping to the TIR-collimator presented in Chapter \ref{chap:boundaries_alpha} and depicted in Figure \ref{fig:analyticlens}. The target PS of this system is the rectangular \set{T}{}{}$= [-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]\times[-1,1]$ with $\variabile{b}=9.7$. The aim is to detect all the possible path $\Pi$ and the rays located on the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ of the corresponding regions in target PS. 
\\ \indent In Chapter \ref{chap:boundaries_alpha}, we found five different paths for the TIR-collimator (see Figure (\ref{fig:Tir2}). The boundaries of the corresponding regions in target PS \set{T}{}{} are in general difficult to approximate. Furthermore, along one direction $\dir{}{}$ more than two points can be located on the boundary $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ of the region \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ corresponding to a certain path $\Pi$. To determine properly all the boundaries 
$\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$, we need to divide the interval $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ in 
\set{T}{}{} into intervals of the same length (bins). Hence, we consider a partitioning 
$Q = -\variabile{b}=\variabile{q}^{0}<\variabile{q}^{1}<\cdots<\variabile{q}^{\textrm{Ni}}=\variabile{b}$ of $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ where $\textrm{Ni}$ is the total number of bins along the $\variabile{q}$-axis.
For each direction $\dir{}{}\in [-1,1]$ the procedure explained in Section \ref{sec:raymapping_explanation} is repeated for every sub-interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{k}}(\dir{}{}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{k}+1}(\dir{}{})]\subset [\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\dir{}{}), \variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\dir{}{})]$ with $\textrm{k}=0, \cdots, \textrm{Ni}-1$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{a}}(\dir{}{}) = -\variabile{b}$ and $\variabile{q}^{\textrm{b}}(\dir{}{}) = \variabile{b}$.\\ \indent
To establish in how many bins \textrm{Ni} we need to divide the target, we exploit \'{e}tendue conservation. We use the same idea applied to determine the value of $\alpha$ for $\alpha$-shapes methods and to provide a stopping criterion for the triangulation refinement (see Chapters \ref{chap:boundaries_alpha} and \ref{chap:triangulation}). 
The source \'{e}tendue $U_1$ is calculated from Equation (\ref{eq:Usource}), obtaining $U_1 \approx 7.7$. The target \'{e}tendue $U_\textrm{t}$ is given by Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}). $U_\textrm{t}$ is calculated several times considering every time a different partitioning $Q$ for the $\variabile{q}$-axis of the target PS. Next, the absolute value of the difference between the source and target \'{e}tendue is obtained from
\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta_raymapping}
\Delta U =  \big|U_1-U_{\textrm{t}}\big|.
\end{equation}
If a small value of $\Delta U$ is obtained, then a good approximation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is found and therefore, the partition $Q$ used for the computation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is suitable for detecting correctly the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$. In Figure \ref{fig:etendue_raymapping_tir} we show how $\Delta U$ decreases by increasing the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}$ in the partitioning $Q$.

In Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping} we show the distribution of the rays traced using the inverse ray mapping method with $\textrm{Ni}=30$ and $\nbin = 100.$ 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{boundaries_ray_mapping_tir}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Rays distribution at target PS of the TIR-collimator.}
 The $\variabile{q}$-axis is divided into $\textrm{Ni}=30$ bins, the $\variabile{p}$-axis is divided into $\nbin = 100$ bins. Around $6*10^3$ rays are traced from the target to the source (red dots). Because of numerical errors, few rays outside the region with positive luminance are found (rays rimmed in blue).}
\label{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping}
 \end{figure}
In this case, inverse ray mapping detects $11$ different paths from the source to the target. 
We observe that only $5$ of them are the paths that we expected from PS ray tracing which are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:paths_tir}
\begin{array}{llll}
\Pi_1&=(1,2,7,12), \\
\Pi_2&=(1,4,6,7,12), & \Pi_2&=(1,10,8,7,12),\\
\Pi_4&=(1,3,7,12), & \Pi_5&=(1,11,7,12).
\end{array}\end{equation}
%(see Chapter \ref{chap:boundaries_alpha}). 
The inverse ray mapping also detect the spurious paths:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:paths_tir}
\begin{array}{llll}
\Pi_6&=(1,2,9,8,7,12), & \Pi_7&=(1,2,5,6,7,12), \\
\Pi_8&=(1,2,2,7,12),& \Pi_9&=(1,7,12),\\
\Pi_{10}&=(1,2,4,6,7,12),& \Pi_{11}&=(1,2,10,8,7,12).
\end{array}\end{equation}
Those paths are due to numerical error, the rays that follow these paths are rimmed in blue in Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping}. The numerical error can be related to the precision of the bisection method and inverse ray tracing. We remark that in inverse ray tracing, the intersection between the ray and the lens (line $2$) is computed using the Newton-Raphson procedure.
To detect only the boundaries of the regions formed by the rays that follow a \textit{real} path $\Pi_{\variabile{j}}$, with $\variabile{j}\in\{1, \cdots, 5\}$, we check the index of refraction that every ray has once it arrives at the source.
If this is equal to the same index of \point{S} ($\n=1$ for the TIR-collimator), then the ray follows a physical path, otherwise it follows one of the paths in (\ref{eq:paths_tir}) and, therefore, it is not considered for the intensity calculation. This gives the rays distribution at the target PS shown in Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping1} where $\textrm{Ni}=30$. We observe that, discarding those rays, $5$ different paths are found. These are the same paths we obtained using PS ray tracing.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{boundaries_ray_mapping_tir2}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Rays distribution at target PS of the TIR-collimator.}
 The $\variabile{q}$-axis is divided into $\textrm{Ni}=30$ bins, the $\variabile{p}$-axis is divided into $\nbin = 100$ bins. Considering only the rays that arrive to the source with the correct index of refraction ($\nline=1$), the regions with positive luminance are computed correctly.}
\label{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping1}
 \end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_TIR_ray_mapping1} shows that the rays on the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi_{\variabile{j}})$ are determined for every path $\Pi_{\variabile{j}}$ with $\variabile{j}\in\{1, \cdots, 5\}$. The ability of the inverse ray mapping method to recognize spurious paths makes it suitable to detect ghost stray light that is unwanted light which can reduce the performance of optical systems \cite{breault1995control}. Optical designers are interested in developing methods for minimizing stray light intensity \cite{grabarnik2015optical}. Inverse ray mapping could constitute an alternative approach for such purpose. 
\\ \indent Note that some rays in the interior of the regions are still traced. This is related to the fact that we divide the target PS along the $\variabile{q}$-axis into $\textrm{Ni}=30$ bins. As a consequence, also the rays located at the end points of every bin are traced. \\
\indent The target ray mapping intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{RM}}$ is calculated using Equation \ref{eq:Ips}. The profile of $\hat{I}_{\textrm{RM}}$ with $\textrm{Ni}=30$ is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:intensity_tir_raymapping} with the red line. It is compared with the reference intensity (blue line) that is given by QMC ray tracing with $10^7$ rays. The picture shows that the inverse ray mapping method calculates the intensity correctly.

\label{fig:intensity_tir_raymapping}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent 
Finally, we compare inverse ray mapping with QMC ray tracing. The errors are obtained from Equation (\ref{eq:error}) and are shown in a logarithmic scale in Figure \ref{fig:error_tir_raymapping} as a function of the CPU-time. The approximation of the RM intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{RM}}$ is improved by increasing the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}$ in the partitioning $Q$. The approximated QMC intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{QMC}}$ is calculated several times gradually increasing the number of rays $\nrays$. Both intensities are computed using the same number of bins, $\nbin=100$ in the partitioning $P$ of the $\variabile{p}$-axis. The minimum ray mapping error is obtained with $\textrm{Ni}=100$ bins, while the minimum QMC error is achieved tracing $10^6$ rays. We observe that the minimal error obtained using the inverse ray mapping is of an order of magnitude of $10^{-6}$, while the minimum QMC error is of the order of $10^{-5}$. Furthermore, an extrapolation of the QMC error shows that the inverse ray mapping is more than $1000$ times faster compared to QMC.

\\ \indent In the next section we present the method for a parabolic reflector.
\section{Results for the parabolic reflector}\label{sec:PR}
In this section we provide the results for the parabolic reflector in Figure \ref{fig:PR}.
This is a very challenging example of an optical system. Indeed, the rays that propagate through such a system can reflect many times along the left and the right mirror. As we have seen using PS ray tracing, this leads to many different paths. Every path corresponds to a given number of reflections with one of the two reflectors. In Chapter \ref{chap:triangulation} we found $17$ different paths for this parabolic reflector. Here, we apply the inverse ray mapping method to detect all this paths. \\ \indent
The target PS of the parabolic reflector is the rectangular \set{T}{}{}$=[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]\times[-1,1]$ where $\variabile{b}=17$. Like for the TIR-collimator, we divide the interval $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ in target PS into sub-intervals of the same length (bins). We remind the reader that we indicate with $\textrm{Ni}$ the number of bins in which we divide the interval $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ along the $\variabile{q}$-axis of \set{T}{}{}. Considering a partitioning $Q = -\variabile{b}=\variabile{q}^{0}<\variabile{q}^{1}<\cdots<\variabile{q}^{\textrm{Ni}}=\variabile{b}$ of $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ and a direction $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$, the inverse ray mapping explained in Section \ref{sec:raymapping_explanation} is applied to every sub-interval $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{k}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{k+1}}]\subset[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$ with $\textrm{k}=0, \cdots, \textrm{Ni}-1$ and for every direction $\variabile{p}\in[-1,1]$. To determine how many bins $\textrm{Ni}$ are needed for a good calculation of the target photometric variables, we employ the same idea of the TIR-collimator. The source \'{e}tendue $U_1$ is compared to several approximations of the \'{e}tendue at the target $U_{\textrm{t}}$ each of them is given by a different partitioning $Q$ of $[-\variabile{b}, \variabile{b}]$. For the parabolic reflector all the rays emitted from the source arrive at the target. Therefore, the exact \'{e}tendue as an area in PS is computed from Equation (\ref{eq:etenduesource}) obtaining $U=U_1=8$. The approximated target \'{e}tendue $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is given by Equation (\ref{eq:etendueintegraltarget}). In Figure \ref{fig:etendue_ray_mapping_pr_bin} we show the comparison between $U_1$ and several approximations of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ by gradually increasing the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}$ in the partitioning $Q$ while fixing the maximum number of multiple reflections to $30$. Increasing the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}$, $U_{\textrm{t}}$ increases approaching the exact value $U_1=8$. After the division into $\textrm{Ni}=4$ bins the improvement is slightly visible. Therefore, we conclude that $\textrm{Ni}=4$ bins are enough to detect $30$ multiple reflections.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{etendue_ray_mapping_pr_bin}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Comparison between the exact \'{e}tendue and the approximated target \'{e}tendue by increasing $\textrm{Ni}$.}
 At most $30$ multiple reflections are considered. Increasing $\textrm{Ni}$, the target \'{e}tendue gets closer to the exact value $U_1=8$.}
\label{fig:etendue_ray_mapping_pr_bin}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent In Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_rays_pr_raymapping} we show the ray distribution at the target PS obtained using inverse ray mapping with $\textrm{Ni}=4$ and at most $30$ multiple reflections. The rays traced from the target to the source are depicted with the red dots. Most of the rays traced are located on the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ of the regions with positive luminance. 
Only few rays are traced inside those regions. These are the rays located at the end points of every bin $[\variabile{q}^{\textrm{k}}, \variabile{q}^{\textrm{k}+1}]$ with $\textrm{k}=0, \cdots, \textrm{Ni}-1$. 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{boundaries_raymapping_pr}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Rays on the boundaries of the regions with positive luminance in target PS.}
 At most $30$ multiple reflections are considered and $\textrm{Ni}=4$ and $\nbin = 100$. Only the rays on the boundaries and on the end points of each interval are traced.}
\label{fig:boundaries_rays_pr_raymapping}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent
The inverse ray mapping method is able to detect $61$ different paths. Indeed up to $30$ multiple reflections can occur at the left reflector and the right reflector. The path that goes directly from the source to the target (no reflections with the reflectors) has to be added. For PS ray tracing we found at most $17$ paths for the same parabolic reflector. Hence, we claim that ray mapping is much more accurate than PS ray tracing. Also, we observe the procedure can be stopped when even more than $30$ multiple reflections are reached. The more reflections are considered better the accuracy obtained. Again, to define a stopping criterion we use \'{e}tendue conservation. Fixing the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}=4$ and $\nbin=100$ and gradually increasing the number of multiple reflections we see that the approximated target \'{e}tendue $U_{\textrm{t}}$ changes as the blue line in Figure \ref{fig:etendue_pr_raymapping}. The horizontal red line represents the exact intensity $U = U_{1} = 8$. We note that the more reflections are considered smaller the value of $\Delta U = |U_1-U_{\textrm{t}}|$ is (see also Table \ref{tab:ray_mapping_pr}). We observe that after around $30$ multiple reflections there is no significant improvement in the computation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$. This is due to the fact that only few rays follow multiple reflections and therefore, they do not give a significant contribution to the total \'{e}tendue, the regions in PS formed by those rays are very small compared to the entire PS. From this we conclude that that inverse ray mapping has a good accuracy when around $30$ multiple reflections and $\textrm{Ni}=4$ bins are taken into account.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{etendue_pr_raymapping}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\textbf{Comparison between the exact \'{e}tendue and the approximated target \'{e}tendue by increasing the number of multiple reflections.}
Fixing the number of bins along the $\variabile{q}$-axis $\textrm{Ni}=4$ and increasing the number of reflections considered, the \'{e}tendue increases approaching to the exact value $U_1=8$.}
\label{fig:etendue_pr_raymapping}
 \end{figure}
Once a stopping criterion is established, ray mapping is run and the rays on the boundaries are determined. Finally, the target intensity is calculated from Equation (\ref{eta2}). 
\\ \indent In Figure \ref{fig:intensity_pr_raymapping} both the ray mapping intensity (red line) and the reference intensity (dotted blue line) are shown. The ray mapping intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{RM}}$ is obtained considering at most $30$ multiple reflections, $\textrm{Ni}=4$ and $\nbin = 100$. The reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ is given by QMC ray tracing with $10^8$ rays and $\nbin = 100$. The two intensities coincide.

\label{fig:intensity_pr_raymapping}
 \end{figure}
\\ \indent
To conclude we calculate the errors between the approximated intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{A}} (\textrm{A}=\textrm{RM}, \textrm{QMC})$ and the reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$. From the results in Figure \ref{fig:error_raymapping_pr} we observe that the RM error (red line) converges faster than QMC error (blues line) as long as an error of an order of $10^{-6}$ is desired. Ray mapping results to be around $1000$ times faster than QMC ray tracing. Furthermore, it is much more accurate than QMC. Our method is able to detect \textit{all} the possible paths that can occur. The procedure is stopped when $200$ multiple reflections are reached. Our expectation is that, increasing the number of multiple reflections and the number of bins $\textrm{Ni}$, the accuracy can be improved even more.

\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we extended the analytic ray mapping method to systems formed by curved lines. Employing inverse ray tracing and a bisection procedure in target PS, an inverse map from the target to the source was constructed such that all the possible paths that the rays can follow are determined. The numerical inverse ray mapping method is able to detect the rays located on the boundaries of the regions formed by rays that follow the same path. From these rays the target intensity is calculated. 
\\ \indent
We presented to examples of optical systems: the TIR-collimator and the parabolic reflector. In both cases the target PS is divided into bins and the procedure is applied to each bin. A stopping criterion based on \'{e}tendue conservation is developed to determine the number of bins needed to obtain a good accuracy. For the TIR-collimator we noticed that the method is able to detect rays that follow a spurious path due to numerical error. This gives the expectation that the inverse ray mapping can be used also for detecting ghost stray light.
For the parabolic reflector, many paths can occur along the reflectors. Etendue conservation is used again to determine the number of multiple reflections to be considered. The target intensity is computed for both systems and is compared with a reference intensity given by QMC ray tracing with a large number of rays. The results shown that the method is able to detect all the possible paths tracing a relatively small number of rays, typically around $10^3$. Comparing our method to QMC ray tracing, significant advantages are observed in accuracy and computational time for both optical systems.
