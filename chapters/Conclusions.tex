\chapter{Conclusions}
In this thesis we investigated new methods based on \textit{phase space ray tracing for illumination optics}. The aim was to understand how light propagates through non imaging optical systems and to calculate the target photometric variables, e.g. luminance or intensity. methods are based on phase space 
To test our ideas we focused on two-dimensional optical systems. \\ \indent
